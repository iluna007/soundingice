							<strong>SOUNDING ICE: sensing frozen flows</strong> explores the
							signals of climate change found in and around the Yukon and
							Klondike Rivers—their confluences and histories.
						</p>
						<p>
							This acoustic cartography is a way of doing-mapping ‘otherwise’. A
							collective practice of sounding and listening to the
							transmissional waves, sonic seepages, and vibrational resonances
							of environmental matter in a state of transformation and change.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is also a way of tuning into the embodied and perceptual
							experiences of living communities as well as a method for
							exploring the deep-currents of histories and memories that flow
							through these ancestral lands.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sound maps ‘sense’ conditions in space and over time. They can
							pulsate and radiate— moving acoustic information through the
							atmospheric mediums of air and the densities of water. They can
							also bounce bathymetric signals and seismic tremblings from
							bedrock back to the frozen rock we call ice.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sound maps defy the cartographic conventions and logics of the
							‘line’ that inscribe powerful and violent asymmetries into land;
							converting relational ecologies into property that can be owned
							and resources that can be extracted.
						</p>
						<p>
							The practice of ‘sounding’ refers both to the taking of depth
							measurements in a body of water as well as the sourcing of
							‘evidence’ needed in a preliminary step towards taking action.
							This project and website documents our collective efforts to
							‘sound out’ local expressions and histories of the
							environment—Earth evidence— and its urgent calls to action.

						<h3>Biographies</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Susan Schuppli</strong> is a researcher and artist based
							in the UK. Her fieldwork and documentary film practice is situated
							at the intersections between environmental struggles, climate
							science, and affected communities with a contemporary focus on the
							cryosphere and the politics of cold. Earlier projects examined
							material evidence from conflict zones to nuclear disasters. Recent
							films include: Moving Ice, Signals from Svalbard, Listening to
							Ice, Gondwana, Arctic Archipelago and Ice Cores. Creative projects
							have been exhibited throughout Europe, Asia, Canada, and the US.
							She has published widely within the context of media and politics
							and is author of the book, Material Witness: Media, Forensics,
							Evidence published by MIT Press in 2020.
						</p>
						<p>
							Schuppli is Professor and Director of the Centre for Research
							Architecture, Goldsmiths University of London and is also an
							investigative researcher with the human rights agency Forensic
							Architecture, recipient of the 2024 Right Livelihood Award.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Nicole Rayburn</strong>’s artistic practice is a
							blundering convergence of video, text, and still imagery. Often
							via appropriation and obsessive repetition, her work humorously
							addresses ideas around ‘the other’, human/non-human relations, and
							concepts of boundary and transgression through the lens of sci-fi,
							history, religion, and popular culture. She is the founder and
							producer of Cold Cuts Video Festival, and is an instructor in
							Time-based Media, 2D Studio, & Visual Studies at SOVA. Nicole
							holds an MFA from the University of Western Ontario.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Iker Luna</strong> is an architect and designer
							based in Costa Rica whose research explores political repression
							and state-sponsored violence in Nicaragua as expressed through the
							built environment. Iker holds an MAArch from the Institute for
							Advanced Architecture of Catalonia. He teach at the University of
							Costa Rica in the Architecture School and currently pursuing a MA
							in the Centre for Research Architecture at Goldsmiths, University
							of London.
