								<p className='description'>
									Drilling a series of holes through the 1.5 metre thickness of
									winter-ice allows us to lower our hydrophones and tune into
									the underwater sounds of the Yukon River. The stillness that
									we experience above ground is met with a vibrant acoustic
									clamour below as the river's movements continue to churn their
									icy channels. If we listen intently we may hear the sounds of
									compressed air being released from chunks of free-floating
									ice.

									The Yukon is already warming at twice the global average. As
									temperatures continue to rise, average annual precipitation
									will increase, becoming more variable. Local impacts will
									include: permafrost thaw, extreme weather events, changes to
									snow, ice and water as well as to vegetation and wildlife.
									River systems will also experience the ravages of warming as
									ice processes are altered. Using our field recorders we
									attempt to track signals of climate change across different
									scales and contexts.

								<hr></hr>
								<p className='description'>
									When solar winds break through the Earth’s magnetic field,
									their charged particles collide with molecules of atmospheric
									gases producing a ‘natural cinema’ that electrifies the night
									sky in luminous shades of green and red. These moving charged
									particles also produce intense low frequency radio emissions.
									Using a series of bespoke microphones we tune into the sonic
									worlds of these natural radio signals.

									signals are converted to sound, again varying on the real
									timescale that you can hear."{" "}

									As feedback loops between the hydrological cycles of these two
									great river systems interact with societal changes as well as
									broader forces, how might we tune into their complex sonic
									worlds and histories? What different climate horizons do these
									rivers now  face; futures that must also include living
									communities, animal habitats and ecosystems as well as the
									many different socio- economic pressures that organise life in
									the North?

										Tombstone Territorial Park.
									</a>
									This is a 2,200 square kilometres protected and unique
									wilderness of rugged peaks, permafrost landforms and abundant
									wildlife, all reflected in a rich First Nations culture. The
									area's Hän name Ddhäl Ch'èl Cha Nän means "ragged mountain
									land." The park is a legacy of the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in Land
									Claim Agreement and lies within their Traditional Territory.
									The Dempster Highway bisects the park and provides an
									opportunity to view stunning arctic tundra landscapes and
									wildlife and access to hiking areas. The concentration of wide
									ecological niches has resulted in a diverse collection of
									flora and fauna uncommon at this latitude.

										Ifor Duncan is a writer, artist and interdisciplinary
										researcher. He is Postdoctoral Researcher on the ERC project
										EcoViolence at the University of Utrecht. Ifor’s research
										focuses on political violence against communities in the
										contexts of degrading watery spaces, processes, and
										materialities. These include river borders, mega-dam
										projects and rivers as dynamic archives of genocide. He
										encounters these concerns through visual cultures, cultural
										memory, and a fieldwork practice that involves submerged
										audio-visual methods. Ifor holds a PhD from the Centre for
										Research Architecture, Department of Visual Cultures,
										Goldsmiths University of London (2014-2019) where he was
										also Lecturer (2022-2024). Ifor was postdoctoral fellow at
										the New Institute Centre for the Environmental Humanities

										(2002), returns to the medium to compose a rollicking Gold
										Rush ballad of newsreels, silent melodramas, comedies and
										actualities. Its argument parallels the early years of
										cinema with the white settlement of North America’s final
										wild frontier, as well as the archaeological digging of
										cinema historians and that of the miners. It’s an intricate
										and holistic look at North American history, from colonial
										encounters with members of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First
										Nation, whose fishing camp was settled as Dawson City, to
										the collapsing capitalism of the Depression and its
										injurious effects. Fim: 2016, 120 mins.
